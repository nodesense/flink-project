Stream values

(W1, V1, T1, 100)
(W1, V1, T2, 110)
(W1, V1, T3, 120)
(W1, V1, T4, 130)

(W2, V1, T1, 140)
(W2, V1, T2, 110)
(W3, V1, T3, 120)
(W2, V1, T4, 160)

130 - 100 = 30 (DELTA)
T4/Round of Time of Clock - 30 as output as stream

ProcessFunction that can deal the previouse values

Totalizer for cumulative - 10000

10000 + 30 = 10030, set as previous value

160 - 140 = 20

10030 + 20 = 10050
